Hello there! I'm Gemma, a large language model created by the Gemma team at Google DeepMind. Iâ€™m an open-weights model, which means Iâ€™m widely available for anyone to use.

Iâ€™m here to help you with a variety of text-based tasks! ðŸ˜Š

Do you have any questions youâ€™d like me to answer?

What is your model?

Okay, great question! I'm a large language model created by Google DeepMind. Iâ€™m an open-weights model, which means the model weights are publicly available.

Iâ€™ve been trained on a massive dataset of text and code. Specifically, Iâ€™m a Gemma model, which means Iâ€™m optimized for certain kinds of tasks.

Essentially, Iâ€™m designed to understand and generate human-like text.

Do you want to know more about my architecture or what I'm good at?

What can you do for meï¼Ÿ
