ðŸ”¹ What is GitHub?

Git = version control system (keeps track of changes in your code, allows collaboration).

GitHub = a website/platform that hosts Git repositories online, making it easy to share, collaborate, and back up your projects.

Think of it as Google Drive for code but with powerful collaboration features.

ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts

Repository (Repo): A project folder on GitHub where your code and history live.

Commit: A snapshot of your changes (like "Save" but with history).

Branch: A separate line of development (good for experimenting without breaking the main project).

Pull Request (PR): A way to propose changes from one branch to another, often reviewed by teammates.

Clone: Download a GitHub repo to your local computer.

Push / Pull: Send your local changes to GitHub (push) or get the latest changes from GitHub (pull).

ðŸ”¹ Typical Workflow

Create a repo on GitHub (or fork someone elseâ€™s).

Clone it to your computer:

git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git


Make changes in your code locally.

Stage & commit the changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"


Push your changes to GitHub:

git push origin main


If collaborating, you may need to pull the latest updates:

git pull origin main
